# Noise-Tools
This Package was designed with inspiration from Sebastian Lague. I used compute shaders to experiment with rendering simplex and perlin noise in 2D. The noise is generated with both hash tables and pseudorandom functions. I also designed a modular UI to manipulate and add different noise types together in realtime. Finally, I implemented the marching cube algorithm to make meshes out of textures.

## Install instructions
